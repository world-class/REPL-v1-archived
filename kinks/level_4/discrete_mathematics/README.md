## Week 10

### 5.212 Domino logic gates simulation

#### Firefox browser

If the simulation fails to load, it can occur due to the hardware acceleration option being disabled. To enable it, go to the preferences (you can type `about:preferences` in the URL bar): then, under **General** tab, search for **Performance** and uncheck the option `Use recommended performance settings`. By doing so, the option `Use hardware acceleration when available` will appear below it. Make sure it is enabled for this domino simulation. For more information on browser compatibility and how to fix possible issues, see [this answer](https://superuser.com/a/836833/1032549) on Superuser.com.
